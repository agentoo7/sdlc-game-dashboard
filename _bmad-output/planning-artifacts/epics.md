## Epic 1: Running Game Dashboard (Foundation)

**Goal:** Developers có thể chạy full stack locally và viewers thấy được basic game screen.

### Story 1.1: Docker Development Environment Setup

As a **developer**,
I want **to run `docker-compose up` and have all services start correctly**,
So that **I can begin development without installing local dependencies**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the project is cloned and Colima/Docker is running
**When** I run `docker-compose up -d`
**Then** three containers start: frontend (port 3000), backend (port 8000), db (port 5432)
**And** all containers show "healthy" status within 60 seconds
**And** I can access `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:8000` from browser

---

### Story 1.2: Backend Health Check API

As a **client app**,
I want **to call GET /api/health and receive system status**,
So that **I can verify the dashboard server is running before sending events**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the backend container is running
**When** I send GET request to `http://localhost:8000/api/health`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with JSON: `{"status": "healthy", "version": "1.0.0", "database": "connected"}`
**And** response time is <200ms (NFR-P02)

**Given** the database is not connected
**When** I send GET request to `/api/health`
**Then** I receive JSON with `"database": "disconnected"` but still HTTP 200

---

### Story 1.3: Phaser Game Initialization

As a **viewer**,
I want **to open the dashboard URL and see a game canvas loading**,
So that **I know the visualization system is ready**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the frontend container is running
**When** I open `http://localhost:3000` in Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge
**Then** I see a Phaser 3 game canvas (800x600 minimum)

**And** page load completes in <5 seconds (NFR-P04)
**And** browser console shows no errors

---

### Story 1.4: Database Schema Migration Setup

As a **developer**,
I want **Alembic migrations to run automatically on backend startup**,
So that **database schema is always up-to-date without manual intervention**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the backend container starts
**When** it connects to PostgreSQL
**Then** Alembic runs pending migrations automatically
**And** migration status is logged to console
**And** if migrations fail, backend logs error but continues running (graceful degradation)

---

## Epic 2: Teams Can Register and Appear

**Goal:** Client Apps có thể register companies và agents, và thấy chúng xuất hiện trên dashboard.

### Story 2.1: Company Registration API

---

### Story 2.4: Dynamic Role System

As a **client app**,
I want **to use custom roles like "security_engineer" that don't exist in defaults**,
So that **my team structure is accurately represented**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I create an agent with `"role": "security_engineer"` (unknown role)
**When** the request is processed
**Then** system auto-creates role_config with:
  - `display_name`: "Security Engineer" (converted from snake_case)
  - `color`: Next available from extended palette (#EC4899, #06B6D4, etc.)
  - `is_default`: false
**And** subsequent agents with same role reuse this config

**Given** all 6 default roles + 8 extended colors are used
**When** I create agent with new unknown role
**Then** system generates deterministic color using HSL from role name hash

---

### Story 2.5: Get Company State API

I want **to remove an agent via DELETE /api/companies/{id}/agents/{agent_id}**,
So that **agents that are no longer active disappear from the dashboard**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** agent "BA-001" exists in company
**When** I DELETE `/api/companies/{id}/agents/BA-001`
**Then** I receive HTTP 200 with `{"agent_id": "BA-001", "status": "removed"}`
**And** agent is removed from database
**And** subsequent GET /state no longer includes this agent

**Given** agent_id doesn't exist
**When** I send DELETE request
**Then** I receive HTTP 404 Not Found

---

### Story 2.7: Isometric Office Layout

As a **viewer**,
I want **to see an isometric office floor with colored department zones**,
So that **I can understand where each role works**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** the Phaser game is loaded
**When** MainScene initializes
**Then** I see an isometric tilemap with 6 department zones arranged vertically:
  - Customer (gray #9CA3AF) at top

**When** MainScene renders
**Then** each agent appears as a colored circle (placeholder art) with:
  - Role letter inside (D for Developer, B for BA, etc.)
  - Agent ID label floating above ("Dev-001")
  - Color matching their role_config
**And** agents are positioned within their role's zone
**And** multiple agents of same role are arranged to not overlap

---

### Story 2.9: Company Selector UI

As a **viewer**,
I want **to see a thumbnail grid of all companies and click to switch**,
So that **I can choose which team to watch**.

**When** the click is processed
**Then** the game view switches to that company's state
**And** the selected thumbnail updates to show gold border
**And** transition completes in <500ms

---

## Epic 3: Teams Can Demonstrate AI Activities

**Goal:** Client Apps có thể gửi events về hoạt động AI, viewers thấy agents moving và working với animations.

### Story 3.1: Event API Endpoint

As a **client app**,
I want **to send events via POST /api/events**,
So that **my AI agent activities are recorded and visualized**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** company and agent exist
**When** I POST to `/api/events` with:
```json
{
  "company_id": "uuid",
  "agent_id": "BA-001",
  "event_type": "THINKING",
  "payload": {"thought": "Analyzing requirements..."}

So that **agent states are updated correctly for visualization**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** agent is "idle"
**When** THINKING event is received
**Then** agent status changes to "thinking"
**And** `current_task` is updated from payload

**Given** agent is "thinking"
**When** WORKING event is received
**Then** agent status changes to "working"

**Given** any state
**When** IDLE event is received

**And** `current_task` is cleared

**Given** any state
**When** ERROR event is received
**Then** agent status changes to "error" (temporary)
**And** error details are logged

**Given** TASK_COMPLETE event is received
**When** processed
**Then** agent status changes to "idle"
**And** completion is logged with artifacts

---

### Story 3.3: Communication Event Types Processing

As a **server**,
I want **to process communication events (MESSAGE_SEND, MESSAGE_RECEIVE)**,
So that **agent-to-agent interactions trigger movement animations**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** BA-001 sends MESSAGE_SEND to Dev-001
**When** event is processed
**Then** server infers actions: `["BA-001:walk_to:Dev-001", "BA-001:handoff", "BA-001:return"]`
**And** movement is queued in `pending_movements`
**And** BA-001 status becomes "walking"

**Given** Dev-001 receives MESSAGE_RECEIVE from BA-001
**When** event is processed
**Then** Dev-001 shows acknowledgment state briefly
**And** event is logged with reference to original message

---

### Story 3.4: Smart Movement Inference

As a **server**,
I want **to automatically infer visual actions from business events**,
So that **client apps don't need to specify animation details**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** WORK_REQUEST event from BA-001 to Dev-001
**When** processed
**Then** server queues movements:
  1. BA-001 walks from BA zone to Dev zone
  2. BA-001 performs handoff animation
  3. BA-001 returns to BA zone
  4. Dev-001 status becomes "working"

**Given** movement is queued
**When** frontend fetches `/api/companies/{id}/state`
**Then** `pending_movements[]` includes the movement with: `agent_id`, `from`, `to`, `purpose`, `artifact`, `progress`

**Given** movement completes (progress = 1.0)
**When** state is fetched again
**Then** movement is removed from `pending_movements`
**And** agent position is updated to final position

---

### Story 3.5: Agent Idle Animation

So that **the dashboard feels alive and game-like**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** agent status is "idle"
**When** rendered in Phaser
**Then** agent sprite shows subtle breathing animation (scale pulse 1.0 → 1.02 → 1.0)
**And** animation cycle is 2000ms
**And** occasionally (5-15s random interval) plays random idle variation (stretch, coffee, yawn)

---

### Story 3.6: Agent Walking Animation

As a **viewer**,
I want **to see agents walk smoothly between zones**,
So that **I can follow the workflow visually**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** agent has pending movement
**When** frontend processes state
**Then** agent sprite uses walk animation (4 frames, 800ms cycle)
**And** sprite position tweens from start to destination at 150px/second
**And** movement follows path through zones (not diagonal cut-through)

**Given** agent arrives at destination
**When** movement completes
**Then** walk animation stops
**And** agent faces the target agent (if handoff)

---

### Story 3.7: Agent Working/Thinking Animation

As a **viewer**,
I want **to see visual indicators when agents are thinking or working**,
So that **I understand what each agent is doing**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** agent status is "thinking"
**When** rendered
**Then** 💭 thought bubble appears above agent
**And** bubble scales in with bounce effect (300ms)
**And** bubble floats slightly (subtle up/down tween)

**Given** agent status is "working"
**When** rendered
**Then** 📝 working indicator appears above agent
**And** agent shows typing/writing animation

**Given** agent status changes away from thinking/working
**When** state updates
**Then** bubble/indicator scales out (200ms) and disappears

---

### Story 3.8: Handoff Animation

As a **viewer**,
I want **to see artifact transfer animation when agents hand off work**,
So that **I can see the workflow progression**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** agent arrives at target for handoff
**When** handoff animation plays
**Then** both agents pause (300ms)
**And** artifact sprite (📄) appears in sender's hands
**And** artifact tweens to receiver (500ms, arc motion)
**And** receiver shows brief acknowledgment
**And** sender then returns to their zone

---

### Story 3.9: Status Indicator Icons

As a **viewer**,
I want **to see emoji indicators for different agent states**,
So that **I can quickly understand agent activities at a glance**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** various event types
**When** rendered
**Then** appropriate icons appear:
  - THINKING: 💭
  - WORKING: 📝
  - EXECUTING: ⚡
  - TASK_COMPLETE: ✅
  - ERROR: ❌
  - BLOCKED: 🚧
  - WAITING: ⏳
**And** icons are positioned above agent sprite
**And** icons have subtle animation (pulse or glow)

---

### Story 3.10: Custom Event Support

As a **client app**,
I want **to send CUSTOM_EVENT with custom icon and animation**,
So that **I can visualize domain-specific activities**.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** I send CUSTOM_EVENT with payload:
```json
{
  "event_name": "database_migration",
  "icon": "🗃️",
  "animation": "pulse",
  "message": "Running migration",
  "color": "#FF6B6B"
}
```
**When** processed
**Then** agent shows custom icon (🗃️) with pulse animation
**And** optional message displays near agent
**And** event is logged with custom metadata

**Given** animation type is "shake", "bounce", "glow", or "spin"
**When** rendered
**Then** icon uses the specified animation effect
