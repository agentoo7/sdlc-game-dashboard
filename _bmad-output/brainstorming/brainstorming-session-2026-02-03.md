# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Binh Tran
**Date:** 2026-02-03

## Session Overview

**Topic:** 2D Game-Style Dashboard - Visualize AI Agents trong SDLC
**Goals:**
- Visualize AI logic (API events → game animations)
- Engage viewers (Tycoon/Sim aesthetic)
- Reflect reality (accurate agent states, artifacts, handoffs)

### Context Guidance

Focus areas from project context:
- User Problems and Pain Points
- Feature Ideas and Capabilities
- Technical Approaches
- User Experience
- Business Model and Value
- Market Differentiation

### Session Setup

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Creative visualization project combining Game Design + API Integration + UX for Tech Contest

**Recommended Techniques:**
1. **Analogical Thinking:** Draw parallels from successful Tycoon/Sim games
2. **Role Playing:** Generate ideas from multiple stakeholder perspectives
3. **SCAMPER Method:** Systematic feature refinement

## Technique Execution

### Phase 1: Analogical Thinking (Theme Hospital / Two Point Hospital)

**Focus:** Draw parallels from successful Tycoon/Sim games
**Ideas Generated:** 71

#### Key Decisions Made:

**Movement & Handoffs:**
- Purposeful walking with carrying artifacts visually
- Artifact size = complexity (small doc vs cart for big architecture)
- Return after handoff animation (hands empty, relaxed walk)
- Overlapping journeys with agent acknowledgment

**Visual Feedback:**
- Emotion micro-expressions (😊 success, 😰 bug, 💡 eureka)
- Emotion contagion (stress/joy spreads to nearby agents)
- Artifact preview bubbles with live typing effect
- Artifact transformation (input doc → output code)

**Art Style:**
- Role-based color coding (BA=blue, Dev=green, QA=red, PM=purple)
- Color mixing on collaboration (gradient bubbles)
- Isometric 2.5D perspective
- Agent ID badges and desk nameplates

**Information:**
- Clickable timeline with agent filter
- Inbox queue visualization at desks
- Availability indicators (green=idle, orange=busy)

**Layout:**
- Organic Flow layout (NO central plaza)
- Scalable zones - expand/contract based on agent count
- Flow follows gravity (top→bottom pipeline feel)

**Multi-Agent Mechanics:**
- Multiple agents per role (Dev-001, Dev-002, etc.)
- Agent ID via API or auto-generated
- Individual visual variants within same role color

### Phase 2: Role Playing (Judge Persona)

**Focus:** Explore from Tech Contest Judge perspective
**Ideas Generated:** 28 (Total: 99)

#### Key Insights from Judge:

**First Impression (5 seconds):**
- Chibi cute characters + movement = HOOK
- Character quality = project credibility
- MUST have motion on load, never static

**Understanding (10 seconds):**
- Labels on characters (floating role + ID)
- Self-explanatory through context/animation
- No tutorial needed - show don't tell
- Color = Role (no legend needed)

**WOW Factors Selected:**
- Live Metrics Overlay (real-time stats)
- Semantic Zoom Levels (out/mid/in)
- Click Agent → Detail Panel
- Drag to Pan, Scroll to Zoom
- Double-click → Follow Mode
- Idle Animation Variations (5-6 random: stretch, coffee, phone, glasses, tap)
- Particle Effects on Events (confetti, sparks, flutter)
- Hover Micro-feedback (glow, scale, cursor)

**Target Audience:**
- Tech-savvy / Software industry people
- No need to explain basic concepts (Agent, SDLC, roles)

#### 🏷️ PROJECT TAGLINE:
> **"Nhìn như game, mà lại là real AI đang làm việc"**
> *"Looks like a game, but it's real AI at work"*

### Phase 3: SCAMPER Method

**Focus:** Systematic refinement and expansion
**Ideas Generated:** 12 (Total: 111)

#### SCAMPER Decisions:

| Letter | Decision |
|--------|----------|
| **S - Substitute** | Keep Chibi characters (cute, scalable, game aesthetic) |
| **C - Combine** | No additional combinations needed |
| **A - Adapt** | ✅ Slack Status Pattern (green/yellow/red dots for agent status) |
| **M - Modify** | Magnify celebrations, Minimize UI chrome |
| **P - Put to uses** | Demo Mode for sales, Screensaver Mode for office TV |
| **E - Eliminate** | No login required for viewing, No complex settings panel |
| **R - Reverse** | Reverse timeline (result → trace back), Easter egg: agents watch viewer |

## 🏆 BRAINSTORMING SUMMARY

### Total Ideas Generated: 111

### Core Concept Decisions:

**Visual Style:**
- Chibi characters (cute, big head, expressive)
- Isometric 2.5D perspective
- Role-based color coding (BA=blue, Dev=green, QA=red, PM=purple, Architect=orange)

**Layout:**
- Organic Flow layout (top→bottom pipeline feel)
- Scalable zones - expand/contract based on agent count
- No central plaza - direct paths between departments

**Movement & Interactions:**
- Purposeful walking with carrying artifacts
- Artifact size = complexity
- Return after handoff (hands empty, relaxed)
- Queue visualization at desks (inbox tray)

**Agent System:**
- Multiple agents per role (Dev-001, Dev-002, etc.)
- Agent ID via API or auto-generated
- Individual visual variants within same role color
- Slack-style status indicators (green/yellow/red)

**Visual Feedback:**
- Emotion micro-expressions + contagion
- Artifact preview bubbles with live typing
- Floating labels (Role-ID + current action)
- Color mixing on collaboration

**Interactivity:**
- Semantic zoom (out/mid/in)
- Click agent → Detail panel
- Drag to pan, Scroll to zoom
- Double-click → Follow mode
- Hover micro-feedback (glow, scale)

**Polish & Animation:**
- Idle animation variations (5-6 random: stretch, coffee, phone, glasses, tap)
- Particle effects on events (confetti, sparks, flutter)
- Easing functions everywhere
- Live Metrics Overlay

**Data Visualization:**
- Live Metrics Overlay (real-time stats)
- Clickable Timeline with agent filter
- Hover → mini sparkline charts

### Target Audience:
Tech-savvy / Software industry professionals

### Project Tagline:
> **"Nhìn như game, mà lại là real AI đang làm việc"**
> *"Looks like a game, but it's real AI at work"*

## 📋 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Create Product Brief** - Formalize this into executive brief (use [CB] command)
2. **Define API Schema** - Specify events structure for agent states
3. **Asset Pipeline** - Commission/create chibi character sprites
4. **Technical Spike** - Prototype with Phaser.js or PixiJS
5. **Layout Mockup** - Sketch the organic flow office layout
