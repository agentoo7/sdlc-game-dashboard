# SDLC Game Dashboard

> **"Looks like a game, but it's real AI at work"**

A 2D Game-Style Dashboard that visualizes AI Agents working in a Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Watch cute chibi characters collaborate, hand off artifacts, and build software in real-time!

## Overview

This dashboard acts as a "spectator view" for AI-powered development systems, consuming APIs to render agents as animated characters working in a simulated software office.

## Key Features

- **Chibi Art Style** - Cute 2D characters in isometric 2.5D perspective
- **Real-time Visualization** - Watch AI agents think, work, and collaborate
- **Interactive** - Zoom, pan, click agents for details, follow mode
- **Live Metrics** - Real-time stats overlay and clickable timeline
- **Role-based Colors** - BA (blue), Dev (green), QA (red), PM (purple), Architect (orange)

## Agent States

| State | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| Idle | Random animations (stretch, coffee, phone...) |
| Thinking | 💭 Speech bubble with keywords |
| Working | 📝 Artifact preview with live typing |
| Walking | Carrying artifacts to handoff |

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Web Application (TBD - likely Phaser.js or PixiJS)
- **Backend**: API-driven (receives events from AI system)
- **Style**: 2D Isometric / Chibi characters

## Project Status

🚧 **In Planning** - Brainstorming complete, moving to Product Brief
